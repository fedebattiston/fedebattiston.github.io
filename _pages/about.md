Hi, I am Fede, and we are the Center for Collective Dynamics!

Since 2017 we are part of the [Department of Network & Data Science](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/) at Central European University in Vienna, where I work as an Associate Professor.

Our group works on the structure and dynamics of network science, with a focus on applications to social systems and the human brain. More details about our research activities can be found [here](https://fedebattiston.github.io/projects/).
